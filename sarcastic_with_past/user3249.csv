BabeNorthern,Sat May 23 21:37:13 IST 2015,@Walleye_Babe I think I'll end up getting one from there. Then if I don't use it I'll resell it 👌🏼
BabeNorthern,Sat May 23 21:35:39 IST 2015,@Walleye_Babe I found some on eBay that are pre-owned but still in the box for anywhere between 30-70 so I was thinking about doing that
BabeNorthern,Sat May 23 21:33:43 IST 2015,@Walleye_Babe I really want one! But my only issue is I don't know if I would end up using it enough to make buying one worth it. 😁
