portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:57:09 IST 2016,   red will not touch him
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:56:53 IST 2016,   liz keeps tom alive she can provide him with a comfortable normal life as long as she lives him
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:53:07 IST 2016,   and tom just goes along with it letting her think that he is tom not jacob
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:51:24 IST 2016,   but who she wants him to be
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:51:06 IST 2016,   personally right now she is looking at tom with a pair of dark glasses not seeing who he is
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:49:14 IST 2016,   but imo hes not and liz is looking at the wrong guy for this stability
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:48:10 IST 2016,   tom is her childs father so she wants him to be stable and good
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:47:03 IST 2016,   or without tom
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:46:06 IST 2016,   i really do think she wants to start anew but she doesnt act like she can be without a man
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:44:14 IST 2016,   that will not be fully normal
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:41:48 IST 2016,   her life will not fully go back to the way it was
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:41:13 IST 2016,   i wish it wasnt this way for liz that she has to find out the hard way
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:39:04 IST 2016,   see some are thinking liz needs therapy
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 23:32:50 IST 2016,  congrats 😊

portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:54:05 IST 2016,p just watch her from afar berlin hired tom to get intimate and marry her
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:53:26 IST 2016,p and kept the fact he hired tom originally a secret that he eventually told and he never hired tom to marry her
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:52:03 IST 2016,p technically he didnt lie to her about hiring tom in fact he told mostly the truth about tom
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:49:00 IST 2016, of course those were lizs assumptions
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:44:25 IST 2016,p  he has not lied to liz so far he has hidden things from her but he has not lied
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:42:56 IST 2016, im with dembe on that liz needs to know the truth about her mother
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:42:02 IST 2016, plus hes hiding things from her that she needs to know
